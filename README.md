# iosAddOne

A very simple project to learn about and use both Swift and XCode. Serves as a good introduction to some of Apple's frameworks as well.

## Postmortem
- It seems like a lot of the functionality for UIViewController follows simliar rules to how Unity GameObjects work
- The management of IBOutlets and IBActions feel very natural coming from Unity. (Love the drag and drop)
- Swift in and of itself is a strange looking language compared to the C++/C# I normally use
  - Feels like a mixture of JavaScript, PHP, and Python.
  - Always appreciate arrays that are actually dictionaries \*chef's kiss\*
  - The constraint system is much more in depth than Unity's own Canvas/UI system, lots to learn there
  - Still room for improvement. An easy add would be implementing GameKit for Game Center functionality (Could be fun?)
- This project **barely** scratches the surface of what's possible in Apple's ecosystem. I desperatelyÂ want to dive into the GamePlayKit framework after looking over the documentation. Hopefully my next project will be something just complex enough to allow me to need some of its functionality!
